Repository for all the data and figures for the Fall 22 HUB XC433 B1: Environmental Equality and Urban Tree Canopies final report.

"Tree Canopy Figures" includes maps generated in qGIS that show metrics like tree canopy coverage by neighborhood in Boston.

"Tree Canopy Statistical Analysis" includes the raw data we found as well as graphs and regression tables made from them

"qGIS Data" has two qGIS projects as well as a shapefile of the Boston neighborhoods modified to fit the city of Boston's 2014-2019 urban tree canopy report.
        neighborhoods.qgz is the project file we used to make the maps, though simply loading Boston_Neighborhoods.shp into qGIS should have the same effect.
        "Canopies and other data" is a project file that includes some other data we looked at but did not use for our analysis, such as the raw tree canopy shapefiles and Boston land plots data. This could be an avenue for future research.

        Our project was done with qGIS versing 3.26 Buenos Aries
